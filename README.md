## 🌍 Top 5 Countries by Recent Netflix Additions (Last 5 Years)

To understand which regions are contributing the most to Netflix’s recent content growth, we analyzed titles added to the platform since 2019. We grouped the data by `country` and `type` (Movie or TV Show), and filtered only the top 5 countries based on total new additions.

This breakdown shows not only which countries lead in volume, but also how their contributions are distributed across content formats.
